The iHart: Interactive Hallways for Attraction and Retention in Technology project provides inexperienced programmers 
with the unique opportunity to develop interactive scenes and games that can be displayed on floors and walls, 
creating a fun and refreshing diversion from the hustle of everyday life for anyone who walks by. 
iHart\'s strengths lie in its intuitive development environment and its easy and inexpensive installation into the hallway.
 The goal of the iHart project is to attract and inspire students to pursue careers in computer science and information technology.
