My name is Barsha Shrestha and I am a senior at Mount Holyoke College. I am a Chemistry major and a Computer Science minor. I got interested in Computer Science my sophomore year after I learned I could build games from my childhood just after taking one coding class! This semester, I am taking Algorithms, Computing Systems, Symbolic Logic (along with relearning ActionScript as part of my Independent Study). I am also working on another Independent Study that deals with computational analysis of perovskties for increase the efficiency of fuel cells. I am also excited to work on more applications as part of the iHart project and hopefully have them display around campus! 

I have been Chemistry 101 and Chemistry 201 TA for the past 3 years. I love teaching and love to be actively involve with the growth of students. I can see this growing into a career in the future. As a Chemistry major with a good amount of programming experience, any project that combines the two and makes wet chemistry redundant excites me. I am also interest in Big Data and think that hard sciences should take advantage of this new and powerful concept. I plan to go to graduate school and somehow mold all my interests into one to be able to study what I am truly passionate about. 

**Computer Science Coursework:** 

 - Algorithms 
 - Computing Systems 
 - Symbolic Logic
