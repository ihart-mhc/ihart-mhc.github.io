# Troubleshooting the iHart software

### Force quit the camera
Some versions of iHart don\'t stop the camera window when the program is exiting.
This problem has been fixed as of version 2.1. 
On older versions, use the Activity Monitor or the Task Manager to quit the \"cvServer\" process.

### Help windows do not show up
When sliding the \'help\' trackbar to the right, an empty window might appear instead of a window with help information.
This is fixed as of version 2.2; the same help information can also be found [here](/software).

### The server can\'t find the camera
Sometimes, the iHart software won\'t be able to detect a camera when starting the main program, 
and the program won\'t run properly. Try restarting your computer.

### iHart won\'t detect faces
There\'s an issue that arises when the application is exported that leads to the exclusion of a file iHart needs to detect faces. This is fixed as of version 2.2.
